    "## Dask-ML - Scalable Machine Learning with Dask\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dask-ML** is a scalable machine learning library built on top of **Dask**, a flexible parallel computing library for Python. It is designed to enable large-scale machine learning workflows that can handle datasets larger than your computer’s memory, making it ideal for distributed and out-of-core computations. Dask-ML extends the functionality of popular machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn by leveraging Dask's parallelism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of Dask-ML:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scalable Machine Learning**:\n",
    "   - Dask-ML allows you to train models on datasets that are too large to fit into memory, enabling machine learning at scale:\n",
    "     - **Out-of-Core Learning**: By chunking data into smaller pieces, Dask-ML processes datasets in parallel, making it suitable for tasks where data is larger than available memory.\n",
    "     - **Distributed Training**: You can train models across a distributed cluster, providing more computation power and reducing training times.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Integration with Scikit-Learn**:\n",
    "   - Dask-ML builds on the familiar Scikit-learn API, allowing easy migration from existing machine learning workflows:\n",
    "     - **Parallel Processing**: Many of Scikit-learn’s estimators can be parallelized with Dask, enabling faster model training on large datasets.\n",
    "     - **API Compatibility**: Dask-ML provides Scikit-learn compatible interfaces, so you can use familiar tools like `fit()`, `predict()`, and `transform()` on Dask collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:\n",
    "   - Dask-ML offers advanced parallel hyperparameter tuning techniques:\n",
    "     - **Grid Search & Random Search**: Distributed versions of these search techniques allow you to efficiently explore parameter space across multiple machines.\n",
    "     - **Incremental Learning**: For some models, Dask-ML can adjust hyperparameters during training, optimizing performance while learning.\n",
    "     - **Bayesian Optimization**: Dask-ML also provides integration with `dask-ml.model_selection.Hyperband` for more efficient hyperparameter optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Large-Scale Data Preprocessing**:\n",
    "   - Dask-ML can scale up preprocessing tasks like:\n",
    "     - **Feature Extraction**: Apply transformations to large datasets using Dask’s parallel computing engine.\n",
    "     - **Scaling and Normalization**: Operations like `StandardScaler` and `MinMaxScaler` are parallelized, allowing preprocessing of massive datasets.\n",
    "     - **Text and Image Data**: Dask-ML can handle large text corpora or image datasets using scalable vectorization techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Incremental Learning**:\n",
    "   - Dask-ML supports incremental learning, enabling training on large streams of data:\n",
    "     - **Partial Fitting**: Algorithms like `SGDClassifier` and `SGDRegressor` support online learning, where the model is updated with each new batch of data.\n",
    "     - **Out-of-Core Training**: By using incremental estimators, Dask-ML handles data that doesn’t fit into memory in a memory-efficient way.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Model Parallelism**:\n",
    "   - Dask-ML enables parallelism at different levels:\n",
    "     - **Data Parallelism**: Train models on large datasets by splitting data across workers.\n",
    "     - **Model Parallelism**: Run multiple models in parallel, such as hyperparameter optimization or model ensembling.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction**:\n",

    "We will begin by installing the package distribution on Mac OS, Linux, and Windows.

Additionally, we will cover the installation of the Jupyter Lab IDE (optional). Finally, we will test our environment and the installed libraries to ensure everything is functioning correctly."

    "### Installing Miniforge on macOS\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Homebrew**: If you haven't installed Homebrew yet, you can do so by running the following command in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**After installation**: Optionally you can run the following two commands to make ensure that Homebrew installation is working correctly and up to date:\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   brew doctor\n",
    "   brew update\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install Miniforge**:  You can install Miniforge using Homebrew with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   brew install --cask miniforge\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative: Using the Graphical Installer**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer a more user-friendly approach, you can download the graphical installer for Miniforge directly from the [official Miniforge download page](https://conda-forge.org/download/).\n",
    "\n",
    "After downloading the installer open the `.pkg` file and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Miniforge on Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Dependencies**: Before installing Miniforge, ensure your system has the necessary dependencies installed by running the next commands:\n",
    "  - **For Debian distributions**\n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "     sudo apt-get update\n",
    "     sudo apt-get install -y curl bzip2\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "  - **For Fedora-based systems**\n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "     sudo dnf update\n",
    "     sudo dnf install -y curl bzip2\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\t**Install Miniforge**: Miniforge is a minimal conda installer that is compatible with Linux distributions.\n",
    "  - Download and install Miniforge:\n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "     curl -L -O https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh\n",
    "     bash Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tUsing the Graphical Installer: If you prefer to use the graphical installer of Miniforge, you can download it from the [official Miniforge download page](https://conda-forge.org/download/).\n",
    "\n",
    "After downloading, make the installer executable and run it:\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   chmod +x Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh\n",
    "   ./Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "### Installing Miniforge on Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Dependencies**: Before installing Miniforge, ensure that your system has the necessary package managers installed. There are three popular package managers on Windows:\n",
    "   - `winget`: Available for Windows 11 and later\n",
    "   - `choco`\n",
    "   -  `scoop`. You can use any of these to install Miniforge.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Using `winget`**:\n",
    "   - If you don't have `winget` installed, you can install it through the Microsoft Store or from [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/releases).\n",
    "   - To install Miniforge using `winget`, run the following command:\n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "     winget install --id=conda-forge.miniforge\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Using `choco` (Chocolatey)**:\n",
    "   - If you don't have Chocolatey installed, you can install it by running the following command in PowerShell as Administrator:\n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "     Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Once Chocolatey is installed, you can install Miniforge by running:\n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "     choco install miniforge\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Using `scoop`**:\n",
    "   - If you don't have `scoop` installed, you can install it by running the following command in PowerShell:\n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "     Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser\n",
    "     irm get.scoop.sh | iex\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - After installing Scoop, install Miniforge using:\n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "     scoop install miniforge\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Install Miniforge Using the Graphical Installer**: If you prefer to download and install Miniforge using the graphical installer wihtout a package manager, you can do so as follows:\n",
    "   - Download Miniforge from the [official Miniforge download page](https://conda-forge.org/miniforge/windows).\n",
    "   - Once downloaded, run the installer, simply double-click on the downloaded `.exe` file  and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing the installation, you can start using Miniforge for managing your Python environments on Windows."

    "### Using Conda or Mamba\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create Virtual Environment**\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   # Create a separate environment\n",
    "   conda create -n xgb-env          # choose any name you prefer\n",
    "   conda activate xgb-env\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Install XGBoost Using `Conda` | `Mamba`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Configure `Conda`: If you are using `conda` mostly, preferably configure it to use `conda-forge` channel to install packages from like this:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   # Add conda-forge channel\n",
    "   conda config --env --add channels conda-forge\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   You may check the configuration using this command:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   conda config --show\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "  - **Mamba preconfigured with `conda-forge`**: If you are using `mamba` skip the previous step, since `mamba` comes preconfigured with `conda-forge` channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Install XGboost**: Now you are ready to use either `conda` or `mamba`:\n",
    "   - **General Installation**: You can proceed with the installation like this:\n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "     mamba install py-xgboost  --yes\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **CPU** only:\n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "     mamba install py-xgboost-cpu --yes\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **GPU** Support with NVIDIA: **Not available on Windows** \n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "     mamba install py-xgboost-gpu  --yes\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Check the Installation**: You can check whether XGBoost installed correctly and what version is installed; to do that run this:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   python -c \"import xgboost; print(xgboost.__version__)\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Or list all the installed packages in the active environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   mamba list\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will list all the installed packages and the dependencies. Or may just want to check the version of the installed polars like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   mamba list | grep -E 'xgboost'\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or on windows:\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   mamba list | findstr \"xgboost\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "You may also wish to check other information, to do that run the next command:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   mamba info\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing `XGBoost`\n",
    "\n",
    "The conventional way to import `XGBoost` is to import it with `xgb` alias like this:\n",

    "# Comprehensive Lesson on Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is an extension of Simple Linear Regression where more than one independent variable is used to predict the dependent variable. The goal remains the same: to model the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable by fitting a linear equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **General Mathematical Formula**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Multiple Linear Regression, the predicted value ($\\hat{y}$) is a linear combination of multiple independent variables ($x_1, x_2, ..., x_p$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{y} = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1} x_1 + \\hat{\\beta_2} x_2 + ... + \\hat{\\beta_p} x_p\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $\\hat{y}$ is the predicted value (dependent variable).\n",
    "- $x_1, x_2, ..., x_p$ are the independent variables.\n",
    "- $\\hat{\\beta_0}$ is the intercept (the value of $\\hat{y}$ when all $x$ values are zero).\n",
    "- $\\hat{\\beta_1}, \\hat{\\beta_2}, ..., \\hat{\\beta_p}$ are the estimated coefficients for the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Model Representation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The general formula for multiple linear regression is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + ... + \\beta_p x_p + \\epsilon\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $y$ is the actual observed value (dependent variable).\n",
    "- $\\epsilon$ is the error term (or residual) representing the difference between the actual and predicted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to find the best-fitting coefficients $\\hat{\\beta_0}, \\hat{\\beta_1}, \\hat{\\beta_2}, ..., \\hat{\\beta_p}$ that minimize the sum of squared residuals (errors).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Representing the Data in Matrix Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Linear Regression can be represented concisely in matrix form, which is particularly useful for computation and deriving the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s represent the model as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "  y_1 \\\\\n",
    "  y_2 \\\\\n",
    "  \\vdots \\\\\n",

    "  \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{X}$ is the $n \\times (p+1)$ matrix of independent variables, including a column of ones for the intercept.\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",

    "  \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "  1 & x_{11} & x_{12} & \\dots & x_{1p} \\\\\n",

    "  \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coefficient Estimation in Matrix Form\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method gives the estimated coefficients $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{y}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{X}^T$ is the transpose of the matrix $\\mathbf{X}$.\n",
    "- $(\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X})^{-1}$ is the inverse of the product of $\\mathbf{X}^T$ and $\\mathbf{X}$.\n",
    "  \n",
    "This matrix formulation provides a compact and efficient way to compute the regression coefficients using linear algebra techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Derivation of Parameters**\n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate the coefficients $\\hat{\\beta_0}, \\hat{\\beta_1}, \\hat{\\beta_2}, ..., \\hat{\\beta_p}$, we again use the **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** method. The OLS approach aims to minimize the sum of squared errors (SSE):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "SSE = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i1} + \\beta_2 x_{i2} + ... + \\beta_p x_{ip}))^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to this minimization problem involves matrix algebra and can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matrix Form of Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "The multiple linear regression model can be written in matrix form as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\n",
    "$$\n",

    "- $\\mathbf{y}$ is an $n \\times 1$ vector of the dependent variable values.\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{X}$ is an $n \\times (p+1)$ matrix of the independent variables (including a column of 1s for the intercept).\n",
    "- $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is a $(p+1) \\times 1$ vector of the coefficients ($\\beta_0, \\beta_1, ..., \\beta_p$).\n",
    "- $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ is an $n \\times 1$ vector of the residuals (errors).\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Evaluating the Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "As with simple linear regression, multiple linear regression models are evaluated using various statistical metrics to assess the fit and accuracy of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. **Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The $R^2$ value measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. **Adjusted $R^2$**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusted $R^2$ is a modified version of $R^2$ that accounts for the number of independent variables in the model. It is used to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Adjusted } R^2 = 1 - \\left( \\frac{(1 - R^2)(n - 1)}{n - p - 1} \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $n$ is the number of observations.\n",
    "- $p$ is the number of independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:\n",
    "MSE measures the average of the squared differences between actual and predicted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "MSE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### d. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**:\n",
    "RMSE is the square root of MSE and is used to measure the average magnitude of the errors in the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "RMSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}\n",

    "### 5. **Example of Multiple Linear Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s consider an example where we want to predict a house price based on two independent variables: **size (square footage)** and **number of bedrooms**.\n",

    "The multiple linear regression model is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{y} = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1} \\cdot \\text{Size} + \\hat{\\beta_2} \\cdot \\text{Bedrooms}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Calculate the coefficients ($\\hat{\\beta_0}, \\hat{\\beta_1}, \\hat{\\beta_2}$)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using OLS, we compute the best-fitting coefficients for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Prediction Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the coefficients are determined, we can predict house prices for new data points using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{y} = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1} \\cdot \\text{Size} + \\hat{\\beta_2} \\cdot \\text{Bedrooms}\n",

    "### 6. **Assumptions of Multiple Linear Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression also relies on several assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linearity**: The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is linear.\n",
    "2. **Independence**: Observations should be independent of each other.\n",
    "3. **Homoscedasticity**: The residuals have constant variance at every level of the independent variables.\n",
    "4. **Normality**: The residuals are normally distributed.\n",
    "5. **No Multicollinearity**: The independent variables are not too highly correlated with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Linear Regression extends the power of simple linear regression by using more than one independent variable. It allows us to model more complex relationships and capture the influence of multiple factors on the dependent variable. By understanding the derivation and evaluation of the model, we can apply multiple linear regression to various real-world scenarios."

    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one independent variable (feature). The objective is to find a linear relationship between the two variables such that we can predict the value of the dependent variable based on the independent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **General Mathematical Formula**\n",
    "\n",
    "The general form of a simple linear regression model can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $\\hat{y}$ is the predicted value (dependent variable).\n",
    "- $x$ is the independent variable.\n",
    "- $\\beta_0$ is the intercept (the value of $\\hat{y}$ when $x = 0$).\n",
    "- $\\beta_1$ is the slope of the line, representing the change in $\\hat{y}$ for a one-unit change in $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Model Representation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable, which can be represented graphically as a straight line. Mathematically, the model can be described as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\epsilon\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $y$ is the actual observed value (dependent variable).\n",
    "- $\\epsilon$ is the error term, which accounts for the difference between the actual value and the predicted value $\\hat{y}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of linear regression is to find the values of $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ that minimize the difference between the actual values $y$ and the predicted values $\\hat{y}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Representing the Data in Matrix Notation (Simple Linear Regression)\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple linear regression, the model can also be expressed in matrix notation for easier computation. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Derivation of Parameters**\n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate the coefficients $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$, we use the **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** method, which minimizes the sum of squared errors (SSE) between the predicted values $\\hat{y}$ and the actual values $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The error (or residual) for each observation is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "e_i = y_i - \\hat{y}_i = y_i - (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of squared errors (SSE) is then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "SSE = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i))^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to minimize the SSE with respect to $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$. The OLS method gives the following formulas for the coefficients:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. **Slope $\\beta_1$**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\beta_1 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $\\bar{x}$ is the mean of the independent variable $x$.\n",
    "- $\\bar{y}$ is the mean of the dependent variable $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. **Intercept $\\beta_0$**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once $\\beta_1$ is calculated, we can find $\\beta_0$ using the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\beta_0 = \\bar{y} - \\beta_1 \\bar{x}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $\\bar{y}$ is the mean of the dependent variable $y$.\n",
    "- $\\bar{x}$ is the mean of the independent variable $x$.\n",

    "### 4. **Evaluating the Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "After fitting the model, we need to evaluate how well it fits the data. Common metrics used in linear regression evaluation include:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. **Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$)**:\n",
    "The $R^2$ value measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:\n",
    "MSE measures the average of the squared differences between actual and predicted values.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**:\n",
    "RMSE is the square root of MSE and is used to measure the average magnitude of the errors in the predictions.\n",

    "### 6. **Assumptions of Simple Linear Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linearity**: The relationship between the independent and dependent variables should be linear.\n",
    "2. **Independence**: Observations should be independent of each other.\n",
    "3. **Homoscedasticity**: The variance of the residuals (errors) should be constant for all values of the independent variable.\n",
    "4. **Normality**: The residuals should be approximately normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple Linear Regression is a foundational technique in machine learning and statistics for modeling relationships between two variables. It is a straightforward method but has powerful applications in prediction and interpretation. By understanding how the parameters are derived and evaluated, you can apply this technique to various real-world problems."
